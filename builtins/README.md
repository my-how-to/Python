# Python Built-in Functions — Learning Module

This folder contains focused lessons about **Python's built-in functions**.  
These are essential tools every Python developer uses daily — they are *not* tied to OOP, not decorators, and not basic syntax.  
They form their own category in Python's learning path.

---

## Purpose of This Module

To provide **clear, practical, example-driven explanations** of Python’s most important built-in functions:

- what each function does  
- how it works internally  
- when it should be used  
- common mistakes  
- edge-cases  
- underlying magic methods (like `__len__`, `__iter__`, etc.)

Each file is runnable and follows the same structure as the rest of the course.

## Files in This Folder

| File | Description |
|------|------------|
| `len_function.py` | Full lesson on the `len()` built-in function |
| `comprehensions.py` | Building collections with list/dict/set comprehensions and generators |
| `lambda.py` | Anonymous functions powering map/filter/sorted and quick expressions |
| (future) `range_function.py` | Understanding `range()`, slicing, iteration, arithmetic length |
| (future) `print_input.py` | Everything about `print()` and `input()` |
| (future) `enumerate_function.py` | Enumerating with index counters |
| (future) `zip_function.py` | Merging sequences in parallel |
| (future) `isinstance_type_id.py` | Type checking and introspection |
| (future) `sorted_reversed.py` | Sorting, reversing, key functions, lambdas |

You can expand this list as your course grows.

## Why Built-in Functions Get Their Own Module?

Because they are:

- used in almost every real Python project  
- too advanced or too conceptual for "Basics"  
- not part of Decorators or OOP  
- unified by Python’s internal *protocols* (length, iteration, hashing, truthiness, etc.)

Grouping them keeps your entire course clean, modern, and easy to navigate.

## How to Use These Lessons

1. Open each `.py` file  
2. Run it in your IDE or terminal  
3. Observe the printed output  
4. Read through comments to understand concepts  
5. Experiment by changing values or adding new cases  
6. Move on to the next built-in when ready

These standalone lessons let you master built-ins *one by one*, building real Python fluency.

## Recommended Order of Study

1. `len()`
2. `range()`
3. `enumerate()`
4. `zip()`
5. `sorted()`, `reversed()`
6. `isinstance()`, `type()`, `id()`
7. `print()`, `input()`

This order mirrors natural usage progression in Python scripts.

## Final Note

This module significantly boosts your Python readiness — both for  
✔ real-world programming  
✔ and Python certification exams (PCEP / PCAP)

Each built-in function is explained deeply but clearly, with runnable examples just like the rest of your course.

Happy coding!
