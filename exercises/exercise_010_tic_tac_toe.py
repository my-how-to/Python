#
# Exercise (PCEP course task):
#   Build a console Tic-Tac-Toe game.
#
#   Rules and requirements:
#   - The computer plays with 'X' and always starts by placing its first 'X' in the center.
#   - The user plays with 'O'.
#   - The board squares are numbered row by row starting from 1.
#   - The user enters a move by typing a square number that is an integer from 1 to 9
#     and not already occupied.
#   - After each move, the program checks for one of four states: continue, tie,
#     user wins, or computer wins.
#   - The computer then makes a move and the check repeats.
#   - No AI required; a random free square is enough.
#
# Goal:
#   Complete the task by filling in the functions below.
#   Do not implement any extra functions.
# ============================================================

#def display_board(board):
    # The function accepts one parameter containing the board's current status
    # and prints it out to the console.


#def enter_move(board):
    # The function accepts the board's current status, asks the user about their move, 
    # checks the input, and updates the board according to the user's decision.


#def make_list_of_free_fields(board):
    # The function browses the board and builds a list of all the free squares; 
    # the list consists of tuples, while each tuple is a pair of row and column numbers.


#def victory_for(board, sign):
    # The function analyzes the board's status in order to check if 
    # the player using 'O's or 'X's has won the game


#def draw_move(board):
    # The function draws the computer's move and updates the board.
