# Core Concepts — Quick Definitions

These short notes capture foundational terms you'll encounter while studying Python and software in general. Each definition is intentionally concise so you can memorize or reference it quickly.

## Compiler
A compiler is a program that translates source code (usually high-level languages like C or Rust) into a lower-level form such as machine code or bytecode before the program runs. The translated result can then execute multiple times without re-translating the original source.

## Compilation
Compilation is the overall process of running a compiler: read source files, analyze and optimize them, and emit executable output. This process often includes steps like lexical analysis, parsing, optimization, and code generation.

## CPython
CPython is the reference implementation of the Python language. It compiles Python source into bytecode (`.pyc` files) and executes that bytecode with a virtual machine written in C. When you install “Python” from python.org, you are almost always getting CPython.

## Command Line Interpreter
Also called a command-line interface (CLI) or shell, this is a text-based program (e.g., Bash, Zsh, PowerShell) that accepts commands typed by the user, runs them, and prints the result. Python also ships with its own interactive command-line interpreter (`python3`), which lets you execute Python statements directly.
