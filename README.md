## Goal

Cover all topics required for the PCEP exam in a clean, review-friendly structure.
Advanced Python topics and PCAP-level material live in a separate repository.

## Exam Notes

Last updated: 2026-01-11

PCEP questions are full of traps and caveats, but spotting them is key to mastering the material.

I aim to pass within two attempts. While the initial course took two months to complete, I am still finding new 'tricky' questions. I plan to spend another two months practicing with this repo.

Personally, I found that the official pre-PCEP course isn't sufficient for the exam, but your mileage may vary. I also estimate that only about 30% of test-takers use a voucher on their first try — I'd love to see the actual data on this.
